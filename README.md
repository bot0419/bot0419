### Hi, I'm Jim Èô≥Èàû,

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com/?lines=üëã+hailing+from+Taiwan!;üíº+a+professional+C%23+developer.;‚ù§Ô∏è+an+advocate+for+open+source!;üêã+familiar+with+Docker.;‚òÅÔ∏è+have+several+cloud+computing+development+experiences.&width=650&pause=1500)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

### ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white) 

I'm a professional C# developer from Taiwan, with specializing in **Web API backend** and **general application.** Besides relying on it for survival, I also used it in my side projects as well. Feel free to explore my [C# repositories](https://github.com/jim60105?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%23&sort=) and my (biggest) side project [Recorder-moe](https://github.com/Recorder-moe).

I have extensive experience in C#, both collaborating with large teams and working independently on small projects. C# is my main programming language, and recently I've been exploring other areas, such as:

### ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white) ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-326CE5?&style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)

I'm pretty well-versed in **containerization technology** and have a knack for creating advanced containers. I can create images that are well-designed, prioritize security, minimal, highly reusable layer caches, and following industry best practices. I have spent a lot of time and effort on this technology, and I believe that what I produce is top-notch. You can find those cool stuff I've worked on in my [Dockerfile-template project](https://github.com/jim60105/Dockerfile-template).

I've got some basic knowledge about **kubernetes** too. In my home lab, I'm running a cluster with bare-metal Talos Linux for my personal services. It was quite a challenge for me to build it and I gained a wealth of knowledge along the way.

### ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white) ![Vuejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue%20js-35495E?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=4FC08D)

To be honest, I have some experience but I'm not skilled in frontend development. As a backend developer, I prefer a function-oriented approach and I must admit that my UI designs could use some improvement. Please take a look at my simple websites - [Sound Buttons](https://sound-buttons.click/) (Angular) and [Unfair Spin Wheel](https://unfair.spin-wheel.click/) (Vue.js). They may not be visually stunning, but they serve their purpose.

Apart from that, I've been experimenting with web development for years and familiar with the tech stack. I see myself as a **"backend developer with knowledge of frontend",** which allows me to approach problems from a full stack perspective.

### ![GitHub Workflows](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ![GitLab Pipelines](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitLab-330F63?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white) ![Azure Pipelines](https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure_DevOps-0078D7?style=for-the-badge&logo=azure-devops&logoColor=white)

I heavily rely on GitHub Workflows for automating tasks in my open source projects. I also utilize Azure Pipelines and GitLab Pipelines at work and have experience in setting up agents/runners and customizing workloads. In essence, **I am able to setup CI/CD across all three platforms.** Check [this](https://github.com/jim60105/docker-whisperX/actions/runs/9924038326) if you want some true example.

Oh, and I am fully familiar with GitOps, which seems to go without saying.

### ![Cloudflare](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cloudflare-F38020?style=for-the-badge&logo=Cloudflare&logoColor=white) ![Azure Functions](https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure_Functions-0062AD?style=for-the-badge&logo=azure-functions&logoColor=white)

I gotta talk about **cloud computing services.** I have delve into both Cloudflare Workers and Azure Functions. They are truly a blessing for those on a tight budget! Thanks to them, I managed to slash the operational costs of [Sound Buttons](https://github.com/sound-buttons/sound-buttons_upload-backend) to practically nothing on the backend servers.

Furthermore, Cloudflare workers are great for [generating open graph meta tags](https://github.com/Recorder-moe/OpenGraphTagBuilder) in front of the SPA and also well-suited for [web applications that experience high traffic](https://github.com/jim60105/simple-poll-system). I have written a few [blog posts](https://blog.maki0419.com/search/label/Cloudflare) on this topic (in Chinese).
